# 8 Bit Arithmetic logic unit using Verilog HDL

## Overview
This project implements an 8 - bit Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU performs basic arithmetic and logical operations on two 8-bit inputs based on a control signal. A simple Verilog testbench is written to verify the functionality.
---
## Operations Supported
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Increment and decrement
- Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
- Shift operations

## Reference
The concepts and approach for this design were referred from the book Digital Logic Design Using Veriog by Vaibbhav Taraate,and the Verilog code was adapted and modified as part of hands-on learning.
